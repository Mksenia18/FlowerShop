Used `.filter()` to find cards with specific keywords.

    - Function declarations (like calculateArea and getCalculation) are hoisted, so they are available before their definition.
    - Function expressions (like calculatePerimeter) are NOT hoisted. Accessing them before their definition gives 'undefined'.
    - That's why getCalculation("perimeter") would fail before calculatePerimeter is defined.
    - Only function declarations are available in the global scope before their definition.
    - This demonstrates why function expressions can't be used before declaration.
    - The main difference between arrow functions and regular functions is how they handle 'this' and 'arguments'
    - Default parameters provide fallback values.
    - Regular functions bind 'this' to the object; arrow functions inherit 'this' from the outer scope.
    - 'var' is function-scoped and leaks out of blocks; 'let' is block-scoped and does not leak.
